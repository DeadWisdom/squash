# squash

Squash is a BDD issue tracker. Users create features through text or a nice web interface, and then 
push them into their repo, either into the main branch or into a new feature branch.

Users can set up Squash to run the features as tests which communicates back to the issue tracker 
when the feature is passing/ready.
